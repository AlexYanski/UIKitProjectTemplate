Welcome to the iOS Project Template! ðŸ“±âœ¨

This repository serves as a starting point and a reference for future iOS projects. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with iOS development, this template provides a solid foundation to kickstart your projects.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Utilizing MVVM architecture promotes cleaner separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and testability while facilitating reusable components within the project.
- **Clean Codebase**: Follows best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
- **Networking Layer**: Integrated networking layer for making API requests, with support for various request types, error handling and caching strategies.
- **Renaming Script**: Simplifies the renaming process for Xcode projects by providing a Python script [rename_xcode_project.py](rename_xcode_project.py) that automates the necessary steps, including renaming the project file, updating internal references, and optionally renaming the main project folder.
    - Place the script in the project directory and execute it with python rename_xcode_project.py.
    - Follow on-screen instructions to enter the new project name.
    - The script automates renaming the project file, updating internal references, and optionally renaming the main project folder.
